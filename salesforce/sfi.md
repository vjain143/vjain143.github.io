## 🔧 Tips for Java Code Success

* Use `List<Integer>`, `Map<Character, Integer>`, and `Deque<T>` frequently.
* Know when to use `Collections.sort`, `Arrays.fill`, and Java 8 Streams.
* In interviews, focus on:

  * Time and space complexity
  * Edge cases (null, empty, duplicates)
  * Tradeoffs in implementation (e.g., HashMap over TreeMap)
