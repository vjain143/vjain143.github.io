✅ 1. Your Intro Pitch (Director / Principal Engineer level)

“I’m Vivek Jain, a Principal Software Engineer with 18 years of experience building enterprise-scale, cloud-native, and AI-driven engineering platforms. 
I specialize in modernizing large, fragmented ecosystems into resilient, Kubernetes-native platforms and engineering the foundational capabilities that accelerate developer productivity and data-driven decision-making across the enterprise.

At J.P. Morgan, I architected and led the delivery of the firm’s first Cyber Data Mesh—bringing together Trino, OpenMetadata, DBT, Kestra, Kafka, Spark, and API-driven data connectors to enable SQL-on-anything analytics across global cyber teams. 
This work was recognized with the 2024 Business Result Award for improving reliability and reducing operational cost by 30%.

My strength lies in combining deep hands-on engineering—Java, distributed systems, Kubernetes, AWS, and CI/CD—with strategic leadership: defining roadmaps, driving modernization, and mentoring high-performing engineering teams. 
I’m passionate about engineering excellence, secure-by-design platforms, and enabling teams to deliver high-quality software with velocity, automation, and strong governance.”
