⭐ KKR Staff Engineer — Risk & Performance

ONE-PAGE NIGHT-BEFORE CHEAT SHEET

⸻

✅ 1. Your 60-Second Opening (Memorize This)

“I’m Vivek, Principal Engineer at J.P. Morgan, leading cloud-native, distributed data platforms.
I architected JPM’s Cyber Data Mesh — Trino, Iceberg, K8s, metadata-driven — improving reliability 30% and analytics 10×.
I modernized legacy Hadoop → K8s, engineered large-scale real-time pipelines, and built SQL-over-API federation.
I lead with architecture clarity, strong engineering practices, and mentoring.
I’m excited about KKR because this role directly shapes the risk platform powering investment decisions — an area I’ve consistently delivered impact.”

⸻

✅ 2. Your Flagship Project (Use for ALL deep-dive questions)

Cyber Data Mesh → C3A
	•	Challenge: fragmented data, slow Hadoop, no governance
	•	Choices: enhance Hadoop vs centralized lake vs distributed mesh
	•	Chose: Kubernetes-native Data Mesh (Trino + Iceberg + Metadata)
	•	Actions: federated connectors, SQL-over-API, GitOps, observability, OPA, dedup quality, mentorship
	•	Results: 30% cost ↓, 10× insights ↑, 20+ domains onboarded, award-winning

Use this for:
System design, leadership, modernization, performance, reliability, impact.

⸻

✅ 3. Your High-Value Talking Points (Repeat Often)

Architecture Strengths
	•	Distributed systems, Kubernetes-native platforms
	•	AWS + S3/Iceberg + Trino + Kafka/Flink
	•	Real-time & batch compute
	•	API + metadata orchestration

Engineering Excellence
	•	GitOps, CI/CD, testing strategy, observability
	•	Infra-as-code, canary releases
	•	Secure-by-design: OPA + IAM + zero trust

Leadership
	•	RFCs, design standards, modernization
	•	Mentorship and uplifting engineering bar
	•	Business alignment + OKR-driven execution

⸻

✅ 4. System Design Template (Use This Outline)

Risk Platform on AWS:
	1.	Ingestion: Kafka/Kinesis → Flink/Spark
	2.	Storage: S3 + Iceberg (ACID, versioning, pruning)
	3.	Compute: Trino / Databricks
	4.	App Layer: Python/Java microservices, gRPC/REST
	5.	Caching: Redis
	6.	Observability: metrics, logs, traces, lineage
	7.	Governance: IAM, OPA, audit trails
	8.	DX: GitOps, CI/CD, automated tests

Always close with:
“Optimized for low-latency portfolio risk and transparency.”

⸻

✅ 5. Performance Optimization (3 Lines)
	•	Columnar storage, partition pruning, Z-order
	•	Redis caching + vectorized execution
	•	Query profiling, continuous tuning, autoscaling

⸻

✅ 6. Leadership Sound Bites (Use These Exact Phrases)
	•	“Architect-first, coach-always.”
	•	“I bring clarity in ambiguous environments.”
	•	“I raise engineering bar through standards, design reviews, and mentorship.”
	•	“Staff Engineers create capability, not just solutions.”

⸻

✅ 7. AI Talking Points
	•	AI-assisted coding, test generation, spec → code
	•	NL → SQL for analysts
	•	AI-based anomaly detection
	•	MCP agents for metadata & governance

⸻

✅ 8. Your 4 Go-To Behavioral Stories

1. Modernization: Hadoop → K8s

2. Conflict: Getting 20+ domains to adopt governance

3. Mentoring: Uplifting engineers through design coaching

4. Crisis: Real-time ingestion / threat intelligence pipeline reliability fix

Have 2–3 sentence versions ready.

⸻

✅ 9. Your 4 Questions for the Interviewer
	1.	“What are the top architectural priorities for the risk platform in the next 12 months?”
	2.	“Where do you want the next Staff Engineer to raise the engineering bar?”
	3.	“What latency, data quality, or scaling challenges matter most to PMs?”
	4.	“What would meaningful impact look like in the first 90 days?”

⸻

✅ 10. Closing Line (Memorize)

“I’m excited because this role sits exactly at the intersection of engineering, data, and decision insights — where I’ve consistently delivered the most impact. I can help KKR evolve its risk platform, uplift engineering quality, and deliver systems that directly enable better investment decisions.”

⸻

⭐ YOU’RE READY

If you want, I can also prepare:

🔹 A 5-minute “audio rehearsal script”

🔹 A rapid-fire Q&A round (KKR-style)

🔹 Your 90-day plan for KKR (very powerful in final rounds)

Tell me which one you want.
