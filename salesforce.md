1. “Can you tell me about yourself?”

Answer:
I’m a hands-on engineering leader with over 18 years of experience designing and scaling enterprise software platforms. My key strengths are in cybersecurity, data mesh architecture, and secure automation. At J.P. Morgan, I recently led the development of the firm’s first Data Mesh, which allows teams to query any data source using “select * from anything” and successfully reduced platform costs by 30%. I enjoy solving complex technical problems while mentoring and leading cross-functional teams. I’m passionate about building smart, scalable platforms that empower both developers and business users. I’m especially excited about Salesforce because its focus on trust, innovation, and powerful cloud platforms strongly aligns with my experience and future goals.

2. “Why are you interested in this position at Salesforce?”

Answer:
Salesforce is a leader in helping companies build scalable, secure, and intelligent cloud applications, which strongly matches my skills and interests. I’ve always admired Salesforce for its focus on customers, strong platform culture, and dedication to trust and responsible AI. This role feels like a great fit because I can bring my experience in distributed systems, automated platforms, and cross-cloud architecture to a global, high-impact team. I’m especially excited about projects like Agentforce and Salesforce’s work in bringing AI-driven insights into business workflows. I’d love to contribute to that future and be part of Salesforce’s next chapter of innovation.

3. “What is your current notice period?”

Answer:
I am currently on a 60-day notice period at J.P. Morgan. I’m happy to make sure there is a smooth handover of my work, and I can be flexible with the timeline if needed to match Salesforce’s requirements.

⸻

4. “What are your salary expectations?”

Answer:
My current total compensation at J.P. Morgan is around €175, which includes a base salary of €145, a bonus of around €30, and benefits. However, I’m looking for a role with greater impact and growth potential, which is why I’m exploring opportunities at Salesforce.

5. “Why are you looking to leave your current job?”

Answer:
I’ve had a highly impactful journey at J.P. Morgan, leading large-scale transformation programs in cyber intelligence space. 
However, I’m now looking for an opportunity where I can work closer to product engineering, collaborate directly on platform innovation across industries, and influence platform strategy at a more global scale. 
Salesforce’s commitment to trusted platforms, APIs, and enablement of low-code/no-code ecosystems is inspiring — and I’m excited to help drive the next evolution of cloud-native and AI-powered platform engineering at Salesforce.

6. “What are your strengths?”

Answer:
	•	Leading large-scale cloud transformations by combining strategic architecture with hands-on engineering execution
	•	Architecting unified data and metadata platforms that bring together analytics, governance, and seamless developer experiences
	•	Managing and mentoring global, cross-functional engineering teams with a strong culture of innovation, accountability, and technical excellence

7. “What are your areas of improvement?”

Answer:
In the past, I used to take on too much of the technical work myself instead of sharing it early with the team. 
Over time, I’ve learned to step back, trust my team more, and let them take ownership. This has helped me grow as a leader and strengthened the team.

A strategic study plan for Salesforce engineering interviews should combine targeted Salesforce technical concepts with consistent practice on LeetCode algorithm problems. This plan balances platform-specific knowledge, system design, and coding challenges tailored to Salesforce’s hiring process[1][2][3].

### Study Plan Overview
- Week 1–2: Salesforce Fundamentals and DSA Basics  
- Week 3–4: Intermediate Topics, LeetCode Medium problems, and Mock Interviews  
- Week 5–6: Advanced Salesforce, System Design, Behavioral, and LeetCode Hard problems[1]

### Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Focus                | Topics & Activities                                                                 |
|------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Basics               | Salesforce: Roles, Profiles, Objects. LeetCode: Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps[2][3]  |
| 2    | Core DSA             | Salesforce: Security, Sharing, Triggers. LeetCode: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues[1][3]|
| 3    | Platform Integration | Salesforce: APIs, SOQL, Flows. LeetCode: Trees, Graphs, Recursion                        |
| 4    | System Design        | Salesforce: Integration patterns, architecture. LeetCode: DP, Greedy, Matrix problems    |
| 5    | Advanced Coding      | Salesforce: Apex best practices, Lightning, real scenario questions. LeetCode: Hard problems |
| 6    | Mock Interviews      | Coding & system design rounds, behavioral prep, review performance[1][2]           |

### Essential Salesforce Topics
- Apex triggers and Flow logic[1]
- Integration with APIs (SOAP/REST)[4][5]
- Security (Sharing rules, Profiles, Permission sets)[2]
- SOQL and data modeling[2]
- System design for scalability and reliability[5]

### Key LeetCode Problems
Focus on these commonly asked by Salesforce:
- K-diff Pairs in an Array (Medium)
- Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring (Medium)
- Number of Islands (Medium)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (Medium)
- LFU Cache (Hard)
- Palindromic Substrings (Medium)[3][6]

### Tips for Maximum Impact
- Alternate between platform study and coding daily (e.g., 2 hours Salesforce, 2 hours LeetCode)[1][2].
- Review solutions in Apex for selected problems, since Salesforce often requires code in their language[1].
- Track progress, reflect after each interview mock, and use feedback to tune your preparation[1][2].

Following this structure will help ensure that you are prepared for all types of questions you may encounter during a Salesforce engineering interview, from core concepts to complex coding tasks[1][2][3].
