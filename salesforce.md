1. “Can you tell me about yourself?”

Answer:
I’m a hands-on engineering leader with over 18 years of experience designing and scaling enterprise software platforms. My key strengths are in cybersecurity, data mesh architecture, and secure automation. At J.P. Morgan, I recently led the development of the firm’s first Data Mesh, which allows teams to query any data source using “select * from anything” and successfully reduced platform costs by 30%. I enjoy solving complex technical problems while mentoring and leading cross-functional teams. I’m passionate about building smart, scalable platforms that empower both developers and business users. I’m especially excited about Salesforce because its focus on trust, innovation, and powerful cloud platforms strongly aligns with my experience and future goals.

I’ve had a highly impactful journey at J.P. Morgan, leading large-scale transformation programs in cyber intelligence space. 
However, I’m now looking for an opportunity where I can work closer to product engineering, collaborate directly on platform innovation across industries, and influence platform strategy at a more global scale.

7. “What are your areas of improvement?”

Answer:
In the past, I used to take on too much of the technical work myself instead of sharing it early with the team. 
Over time, I’ve learned to step back, trust my team more, and let them take ownership. This has helped me grow as a leader and strengthened the team.
