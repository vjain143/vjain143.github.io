1. “Can you tell me about yourself?”

Answer:
I am a hands-on engineering leader with over 18 years of experience designing and scaling enterprise-grade platforms, with a specialization in cloud-native architectures, data mesh, and secure automation. Most recently, at J.P. Morgan, I led the design and rollout of the firm’s first Kubernetes-based Cyber Data Mesh, delivering “SQL-on-anything” analytics across dozens of cyber domains and reducing operational cost by 30%. I thrive at the intersection of technical strategy and team mentorship, and I’m passionate about building intelligent, scalable platforms that empower business users and developers alike. Salesforce’s mission to build trusted and innovative cloud platforms aligns strongly with my experience and aspirations.
