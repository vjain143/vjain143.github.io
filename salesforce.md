1. “Can you tell me about yourself?”

Answer:
I’m a hands-on engineering leader with over 18 years of experience designing and scaling enterprise software platforms. My key strengths are in cybersecurity, data mesh architecture, and secure automation. At J.P. Morgan, I recently led the development of the firm’s first Data Mesh, which allows teams to query any data source using “select * from anything” and successfully reduced platform costs by 30%. I enjoy solving complex technical problems while mentoring and leading cross-functional teams. I’m passionate about building smart, scalable platforms that empower both developers and business users. I’m especially excited about Salesforce because its focus on trust, innovation, and powerful cloud platforms strongly aligns with my experience and future goals.
