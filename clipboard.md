Positives (3):
	1.	Hands-on experience with Java + Spring Boot on real client-facing systems (5G core, AWS Lambda → S3 → RDS).
	2.	Good breadth: has touched Kubernetes/Helm, Docker, AWS, Kafka, SQL, basic design patterns, CI/CD, observability.
	3.	Communicates clearly, takes ownership, and is honest about what she doesn’t know.

Negatives (3):
	1.	Java fundamentals shaky in places (equals/hashCode contract, TreeSet ordering, atomic types, static memory model).
	2.	Spring / transactions / DI depth limited (can name concepts but struggles to explain how and why in detail).
	3.	Kubernetes/infra & Kafka understanding more operational than conceptual (pods vs containers, autoscaling logic, consumer groups, exactly-once/at-least-once semantics).


  The candidate shows good hands-on experience across Java, Spring Boot, AWS, and basic Kubernetes workflows. She communicates clearly, has practical exposure to real projects, and demonstrates the right attitude and willingness to learn. While there are gaps in fundamental Java and Kubernetes internals, her breadth, problem-solving approach, and ownership make her a strong fit for the next stage. I recommend moving her to the next round with a focus on deeper technical probing.
