✅ 1. Your Intro Pitch (Director / Principal Engineer level)

“I’m Vivek Jain, a Principal Software Engineer with 18 years of experience building enterprise-scale, cloud-native, and AI-driven engineering platforms. 
I specialize in modernizing large, fragmented ecosystems into resilient, Kubernetes-native platforms and engineering the foundational capabilities that accelerate developer productivity and data-driven decision-making across the enterprise.

At J.P. Morgan, I architected and led the delivery of the firm’s first Cyber Data Mesh—bringing together Trino, OpenMetadata, DBT, Kestra, Kafka, Spark, and API-driven data connectors to enable SQL-on-anything analytics across global cyber teams. 
This work was recognized with the 2024 Business Result Award for improving reliability and reducing operational cost by 30%.

My strength lies in combining deep hands-on engineering—Java, distributed systems, Kubernetes, AWS, and CI/CD—with strategic leadership: defining roadmaps, driving modernization, and mentoring high-performing engineering teams. 
I’m passionate about engineering excellence, secure-by-design platforms, and enabling teams to deliver high-quality software with velocity, automation, and strong governance.”

High-Impact, Story-Based Pitch (60–90 seconds)

“My most recent project was architecting JPMC’s Distributed Cyber Data Mesh platform—essentially rebuilding the firm’s cyber-intelligence and analytics ecosystem from the ground up. 
The problem was that cyber data lived in 20+ silos, on Hadoop, legacy databases, APIs, and vendor feeds. Engineering teams struggled with inconsistent pipelines, operational fragility, long onboarding times, and no unified data platform for analytics or automation.

I designed and led the end-to-end buildout of a Kubernetes-native platform powered by Trino, OpenMetadata, Kafka, Spark, Kestra, and custom Java-based SQL-over-API connectors. 
We implemented event-driven ingestion, federated metadata governance, and a self-service platform where cyber teams could query any source—Hadoop, REST APIs, SaaS platforms—in seconds instead of weeks.

We also integrated major threat-intel sources like VirusTotal, ThreatConnect, and FireEye using STIX/TAXII standards, enabling automated detection workflows. 
The result was 50% improved scalability, 30% lower infra cost, and a 10× reduction in time to insights. This platform became the foundation for the firm’s AI enablement and cyber-resilience strategy.”
